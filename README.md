## Local Development

### Running in Replit
The website is already configured to run in Replit using the built-in workflow system:

1. The workflow automatically serves the site on port 5000
2. Access your site through the Replit webview
3. All changes are automatically reflected

### Manual Setup
If you need to run this locally outside of Replit:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd your-project-folder

# Start a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 5000

# Or using Node.js
npx serve -p 5000

# Or using any static file server of your choice
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

## Deployment Options

### 1. Replit Deployment
- Use Replit's built-in deployment feature
- Automatically handles scaling and SSL
- Perfect for demos and production

### 2. Static Hosting Services
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the project folder
- **Vercel**: Connect your Git repository
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to a GitHub repository and enable Pages
- **AWS S3**: Upload files to an S3 bucket with static hosting

### 3. Traditional Web Hosting
- Upload all files to your web hosting provider
- Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
- No server-side requirements needed

## Browser Compatibility

```

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #00d4ff;
    --secondary-color: #ff6b9d;

}
```

### Adding New Sections
